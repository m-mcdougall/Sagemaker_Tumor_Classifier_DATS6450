#Log into your ec2 with MobaXterm
#You can probably use a different ssh client, but I havenâ€™t tested with others.


#In root, execute the following code:
mkdir notebooks
pip install jupyter   #Note: this may be pip3 depending on your ec2 version

#Add jupyter location to your PATH
echo "PATH=$PATH://home/ubuntu/.local/bin" >> .bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

#Launch notebook
cd notebooks
jupyter notebook --ip=* --allow_origin=*


#With notebook running, modify the following code and run it **in a different mobaxterm tab**
#Start ssh tunneling
ssh -NL 8888:localhost:8888 [ubuntu/ec2-user]@[your Public IPv4 address] -i [the path to your private key]


#Open notebooks in a browser
#Copy the url from the first mobaxterm tab, and it should work!
